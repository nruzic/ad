Scope and Responsibilities

Any capability of the system X not explicitly listed in this section is by default exluded from the system scope 
and as such will not be part of the design of the system in place. 

For clarity, this section can contain some specific capability exclusions, although, as stated above, any capability 
which is not explicitly listed in this section should be considered excluded from the system scope.

The scope definition for the system X includes:

1. System shall provide logging capability by writing system relevant events into system local log files.
   System relevan events are any warnings, errors or exceptions which occure within system process.
   System local log files is textual file allocated on the same phisical or virtual machine running the system process.
   Format of the logging statements written into the log file by the system is not explicitly defined and is left arbitrary 
   as long as it contains sufficient information for translation into central logging system.
